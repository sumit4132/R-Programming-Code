####################### INBUILT FUNCTION QUESTIONS #######################

#1.	Do these operations with the head() function:
  #a.	Get the first 4 records from 'PhoneService' column
  #b.	Get the first 8 records from 'Contract' column

head(customer_churn$PhoneService,4)
head(customer_churn$Contract,8)


# 2.	Do these operations with the tail() function:
# a.	Get the last record of 'TotalCharges' column
# b.	Get the last 5 records of 'tenure' column

tail(customer_churn$TotalCharges,1)
tail(customer_churn$tenure,5)


# 3. Find the average, minimum, maximum & range from the 'tenure' column
mean(customer_churn$tenure)
min(customer_churn$tenure)
max(customer_churn$tenure)
range(customer_churn$tenure)


# 4. Getting 10 random values from the 'TotalCharges' column using sample()
sample(customer_churn$TotalCharges, 10)

# 5.	Find the count of different levels in 'PaymentMethod' & 'Contract' columns using table()

table(customer_churn$PaymentMethod)
