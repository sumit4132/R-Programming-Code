# 2.	Create a list named 'jumbo' which comprises of:
# a.	A character vector comprising of alphabets from A to D
# b.	A numeric vector comprising of numbers from 55 to 60
# c.	A logical vector comprising of just these two values: True, False
#  i.	Now, access the third value from the first element of the list
#  ii.	Access the 2nd value from the 2nd element of the list
#  iii.	Access the 1st value from the 3rd element of the list
